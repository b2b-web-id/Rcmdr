Version 0.5-0: initial version in package form

Version 0.6-0

    o Rather than being hard-wired, menus are now configured in the menus/Rcmdr-menus.txt file and can be modified or supplemented by the user (suggested by Frank Harrell).

    o Allow font-size selection via options("Rcmdr.fontsize") for text in the log window.

    o Set pager to tkpager (suggested by Martin Maechler).

    o Cleaned up menus and dialog boxes.
    
    o Added ability to load log files.
    
    o Reorganized items on File and Data menus (suggested by Martin Maechler).

    o Added jitter option to scatterplots.
    
    o Many new input-error checks.
    
    o Added delete-variable dialog.
    
    o Added provision for optionally invoking tkwait while the Commander runs.
    
    o Added help menu.
    
Version 0.7-1

    o Help buttons fixed so that they don't hang tkpager when it's used to display help files; tkpager only used now on non-Windows systems.
    
Version 0.8-0

    o More error checking.
    
    o Don't allow a non-data-frame to become the active data set.

    o Added "Reorder factor levels" menu item and dialog (suggested by Bob Andersen).
    
    o Reorganized Data menu, adding "Manage variables" sub-menu.
    
    o New version of "Read data set from an attached package" dialog (suggested by several people).
    
    o Added "influence plots" to the Model menu (suggested by Bob Andersen).
    
Version 0.8-1

Version 0.8-2

    o Further error checks.
    
    o Added variance-inflation factors to Model menu.

    o Added Spearman rank-order and partial correlations to the Correlation Matrix dialog.
    
    o Added Standardize item to Data -> Manage variables menu.
    
    o Reorganized Data menu, adding "Data in packages" and  "Active data set" submenus, and items to get help on active data set and to list variables in it.
    
Version 0.8-3

    o Changed Compute dialog to use with(activeDataSet, expression) rather than to evaluate the expression in the global environment.
    
    o Added RcmdrPager function for non-Windows systems, a version of the tkpager modified slightly to use the Rcmdr monospaced font and a white background. This is for non-Windows systems.
    
    o Added Data -> Active data set -> Export active data set.
    
    o Reworked package initialization so as not to fail when a required package -- probably car -- is missing (thanks to Brian Ripley for help here).
    
    o Reworked options, mostly for better font support in non-Windows systems, but also to allow configurable size of log window, etc. Made default log window larger.
    
    o Added check box to the Commander window to enable/disable attaching of active data set.
    
    o Added flexibility to Data -> Import data -> From text file. Other small changes to Delete variables and Recode dialogs.

    o Cleaned up some dialogs -- for example, lm and glm dialogs have initial focus in the lhs field and tab directly to the rhs field.
    
    o Changes to all dialogs to ensure better behaviour, particularly in fast Windows XP systems: preventing scrollbars from sticking and dialogs from displaying completely (thanks to Peter Dalgaard and, especially, Marc Schwartz).
    
    o Re-executing lines from the log with assignment to a list (or data frame) element (e.g., data$x <- y) now works.

Version 0.8-4

    o Minor bug fixes and additional input-error checks (many suggested by Tony Christensen).
    
    o Documentation for Recode, Compute, linearModel, and generalizedLinearModel dialogs. More extensive documentation for the Commander.

    o Changes to list*() utility functions to ensure that all objects of a given class are found, and not masked by local variables or objects in the base package.

    o Many small changes to ensure that objects in the global environment are not masked by objects in the base package.

    o Added Graphs -> Line graph.
    
Version 0.9-0

    o More flexible customization. All config files are now in the etc subdirectory, including:
    
      - Rcmdr-menus.txt: defines the Rcmdr menus
      
      - log-exceptions.txt: a list of functions that are prevented from printing output when executed from the log window.

      - compareModels.demo: contains a demonstration of how to add a dialog to Rcmdr. Rename this file to compareModels.R and uncomment the corresponding menu-definition line in Rcmdr-menus.txt.

    o Some more functions in the package are exported to support writing extensions.
    
    o Made active-data-set and active-model "information fields" into buttons that can be used to select the active data set and model.

    o Added "Subset active data set", "Remove cases with missing data", and "Set case names" to Data -> Active data set menu.
    
    o Added many error checks for adequate variables in the active data set.
    
    o Ensured that focus returns to the proper window after an error.
    
    o Commands generated by View and Edit Data Set buttons now appear in the log and sessions windows.

    o As an option, bound double-left-mouse-click to default button in all dialogs.
    
    o Added more sophisticated interface for linearModel and generalizedLinearModel dialogs (suggested by Bob Stine).
    
    o Where appropriate, previous field-values are retained in linearModel and generalizedLinearModel dialogs (suggested by Sandy Weisberg). Models are numbered.
    
    o Generalized-linear models dialog now only shows appropriate links for the currently selected family.
        
    o Added "Data -> New data set" menu, which opens data editor with empty data frame.
    
    o Much improved stem-and-leaf display using stem.leaf function (courtesy of Peter Wolf).
    
    o Added "grab.focus" option to allow disabling focus grabs on systems where this causes problem.
    
    o Added "File -> Options" menu to set options and restart the Commander.
    
    o On exit, the Commander cleans up global variables used for program control (from correspondence with Kjetil Brinchmann Halvorsen).

    o Added distribution plots to the Distributions menu (suggested by Yan Wong).
    
    o Small interface changes and bug fixes.
    
Version 0.9-2

    o Added Hist function, a wrapper to hist permitting percentage as well as frequency and density scaling.
    
    o Added "Data -> Manage variables in active data set -> Rename variables" menu and dialog, mostly to get around crashes due to changing names in the data editor.
    
    o Improved formatting of percentage tables; now require abind package.
    
    o Added "Statistics -> Contingency Tables -> Enter and analyze two-way table" menu and dialog (suggested by Aniko Szabo).

    o Added "Models -> Residual quantile-comparison plot" menu and dialog.
    
    o Added option to suppress edit button in the Commander window (to avoid crashes in Windows).
    
    o Fixed problem that arose (associated with internal use of <<-) when using a data set exported from a package with a namespace (e.g, MASS).
    
    o Added Edit menu with Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Find, and Select all (suggested by Brian Ripley).
    
    o Added a right-click "context" menu to the log/script window.
        
    o Small changes.

Version 0.9-3

    o Reorganized Models menu using sub-menus (Hypothesis tests, Numerical diagnostics, Graphs).
    
    o Added "Models -> Hypothesis tests -> Test linear hypothesis" menu and dialog.
    
    o Added "Models -> Hypothesis tests -> Compare models" menu and dialog.
    
    o Added Breusch-Pagan test, Durbin-Watson test, and RESET test to "Models -> Numerical diagnostics" menu; lmtest package now required.
    
    
Version 0.9-4
    
    o Cleaned up code in enterTable and testLinearHypothesis functions to eliminate use of global variables.

    o Now use the showData function in the relimp package to display data frames (thanks to David Firth).
    
    o Added commas as decimal points as an option to inport text files (as suggested by Philippe Grosjean).
    
    o Try to insure that the active data set stays in sync with the active model when data sets or models are changed (suggested by Philippe Grosjean).
    
    o Added "Graphs -> 3D scatterplot" menu and dialog and supporting scatter3d function; depends on mgcv and rgl packages, the latter available at <http://wsopuppenkiste.wiso.uni-goettingen.de/~dadler/rgl/>.

    o Added "Models -> Numerical diagnostics -> Bonferroni outlier test".
    
    o New sort.names Rcmdr option; if TRUE (now the default), names of variables are sorted alphabetically in variable lists.
    
    o Small changes to handling lines executed from the log.
    
    o Small bug fixes and interface improvements. 
    
Version 0.9-5
