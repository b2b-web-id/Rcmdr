Version 0.5-0: initial version in package form

Version 0.6-0

    o Rather than being hard-wired, menus are now configured in the menus/Rcmdr-menus.txt file and can be modified or supplemented by the user (suggested by Frank Harrell).

    o Allow font-size selection via options("Rcmdr.fontsize") for text in the log window.

    o Set pager to tkpager (suggested by Martin Maechler).
    
    o Added "Exit" menu items; intercept R Commander window close (suggested by Martin Maechler).
    
    o Cleaned up menus and dialog boxes.
    
    o Added ability to load log files.
    
    o Reorganized items on File and Data menus (suggested by Martin Maechler).
    
    o Added point-identification to scatterplots (suggested by Bob Andersen).
    
Version 0.7-0

    o Added subset expressions to model dialog boxes and some other dialogs calling functions using formulas.
    
    o Added jitter option to scatterplots.
    
    o Many new input-error checks.
    
    o Added delete-variable dialog.
    
    o Added provision for optionally invoking tkwait while the Commander runs.
    
    o Added help menu.
    
Version 0.7-1

    o Help buttons fixed so that they don't hang tkpager when it's used to display help files; tkpager only used now on non-Windows systems.
    
Version 0.8-0

    o More error checking.
    
    o Don't allow a non-data-frame to become the active data set.
    
    o Added "Convert numeric variable to factor" menu item and dialog (suggested by Bob Andersen and Peter Dalgaard).
    
    o Added "Reorder factor levels" menu item and dialog (suggested by Bob Andersen).
    
    o Reorganized Data menu, adding "Manage variables" sub-menu.
    
    o New version of "Read data set from an attached package" dialog (suggested by several people).
    
    o Added "influence plots" to the Model menu (suggested by Bob Andersen).
    
Version 0.8-1

    o Added "add observation statistics" to Model menu.
    
Version 0.8-2

    o Further error checks.
    
    o Added variance-inflation factors to Model menu.
    
    o Added Statistics -> Dimensional analysis menu with scale reliability, principal-components analysis, and factor analysis (suggested by Bob Andersen).
    
    o Added Spearman rank-order and partial correlations to the Correlation Matrix dialog.
    
    o Added Standardize item to Data -> Manage variables menu.
    
    o Reorganized Data menu, adding "Data in packages" and  "Active data set" submenus, and items to get help on active data set and to list variables in it.
    
Version 0.8-3

    o Changed Compute dialog to use with(activeDataSet, expression) rather than to evaluate the expression in the global environment.
    
    o Added RcmdrPager function for non-Windows systems, a version of the tkpager modified slightly to use the Rcmdr monospaced font and a white background. This is for non-Windows systems.
    
    o Added Data -> Active data set -> Export active data set.
    
    o Reworked package initialization so as not to fail when a required package -- probably car -- is missing (thanks to Brian Ripley for help here).
    
    o Reworked options, mostly for better font support in non-Windows systems, but also to allow configurable size of log window, etc. Made default log window larger.
    
    o Added check box to the Commander window to enable/disable attaching of active data set.
    
    o Added flexibility to Data -> Import data -> From text file. Other small changes to Delete variables and Recode dialogs.
    
    o Added Statistics -> Summaries -> Active data set.
    
    o Cleaned up some dialogs -- for example, lm and glm dialogs have initial focus in the lhs field and tab directly to the rhs field.
    
    o Changes to all dialogs to ensure better behaviour, particularly in fast Windows XP systems: preventing scrollbars from sticking and dialogs from displaying completely (thanks to Peter Dalgaard and, especially, Marc Schwartz).
    
    o Re-executing lines from the log with assignment to a list (or data frame) element (e.g., data$x <- y) now works.
